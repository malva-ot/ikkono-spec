# Parameters

The "public key"  for ed25519 is the parameter "X"
The "private key" for ed25519 is the parameter "d"

This explicitly uses a technique, highlighted in https://cr.yp.to/ecdh/patents.html, that the y coordinate does not need to be "transmitted" for use in key exchange. I.e. the x coordinate alone is sufficient for use as a public key.

## Invention and implementation - NaCl, libsodium, TweetNacl
Curve 25519, and its subsequent application to signatures as Ed25519 and encryption as X25519, were invented and published by preeminent cryptographer Daniel Bernstein, and he also wrote the original reference software implementation in a library he called NaCl, and additional enhancements he implemented in a cryptographic benchmarking suite called SUPERCOP. 

Professional software engineers carried the effort from there, implementing the gold standard library called `libsodium` in C. 

libsodium is **the** established, proven implementation of ed25519. Essentially all software written in C that use Curve 25519 use `libsodium`. There have likewise been ports to other languages. Some use runtime bindings to the underlying C implementation, while others reimplement the algorithm.

### Semantics

Because all implementations are based on Bernstein's initial work, they follow his overall semantics. Notably, his names for the signing APIs are generic, even though they *are* the implementation of ed25519. 

- `crypto_sign_keypair` really means "generate an Ed25519 key pair". 
- `pk` and `sk` parameters, representing "public key" and "secret key", really map to the parameters traditionally labeled `x` and `d` in conceptual discussions
- `crypto_sign_detached` means "calculate the Ed25519 signature given the message bytes and private key (`d`) bytes". 

Direct adaptations of `NaCl` / `libsodium` maintain these generic semantics, while wrappers often relabel them to be clearer and distinguishable from other cryptographic methods, for example with APIs like `Ed25519.GenerateKey()` or `Ed25519.Sign(...)`, etc.

### JavaScript implementations

There are basically [three established implementations](https://gist.github.com/jonasfj/af453cc2c569312ac59f) in JavaScript:

- [`node-sodium`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium) (package name `sodium`) is a JS binding to the actual C implementation. It is very fast (since it is really C), but it is also only runnable on servers, and presents all the recompilation / interop issues of using the C library.
- [`js-nacl`](https://github.com/tonyg/js-nacl) is a direct transpilation of libsodium using [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten) 
- [tweetnacl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl) is a native implementation of the algorithms in idiomatic JS. It is the slowest, but also has better docs and an [actual security audit](https://cure53.de/tweetnacl.pdf) to vouch for the correctness of its implementation.

The speed differences are dramatic. `js-nacl` is 2-5x faster than `tweetnacl`'s "fast" variant, but `sodium` (C binding) is 200-500x faster than `tweetnacl`. In practical terms, here are the rough elapsed times for signing a typically short message:

- `sodium` - 0.1 ms
- `js-nacl` - 10 ms
- `tweetnacl` - 50 ms

For a browser, either of JS implementations may be fine. For a server running frequent validations of Ed25519 tokens, the cost difference may justify working with `sodium`.
