notes: >-
  Constraints and filters have the same structure but different effects. Constraints limit which 
  questions will receive an affirmative answer from the accountant to the application, while filters 
  limit the contents of an allowed response from an application to the consumer.

  A query which is more general than any defined constraint would receive an access denied (403) 
  response. 

  A query which is more general than any defined filter is expected; it would receive an access 
  allowed (20x) response but the result set would be automatically filtered *by the application, 
  not by the accountant*, to those resources which match the filter(s).
