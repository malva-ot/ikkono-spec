notes: >-
  A passport is approximately equivalent to the "user" concept in most existing
  software applications, or an "employee" within most institutional directories.

  The alias for a passport would generally be the moniker adopted by the actor
  themselves, unless there is a naming conflict within a ledger, or the owner of 
  the ledger wishes to apply some particular naming convention.

  Likewise the displayName would generally be adopted from the actor, unless the 
  ledger owner has specific standards or conventions about display names
