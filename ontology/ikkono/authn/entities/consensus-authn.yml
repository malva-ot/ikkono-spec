  The primary use case for consensus authentication is for delegation of agency from an authority
  to multiple actors. For accountability and process safety, it would be wise for an authority to 
  concurrently assign multiple actors as delegates, and then specify that they must authenticate 
  using a shared consensus authentication method. This requires that, for example, at least two 
  of three delegated actors would need to sign any action to be taken on behalf of the authority.

  The consensus auth record belongs to (is issued by) the principal which wishes to authenticate, 
  e.g. an issuing authority. The individual component methods each belong to other principals, 
  usually actors, which will authenticate in order to act on behalf of the authority.

  In order for some action to be valid, there must *also* be valid delegation (authz.Delegation)
  records for each of the principals authenticating on behalf of the issuer. That is, the 
  consensus auth specifies how the delegated actors must prove their identity, but does not 
  in itself give those actors the power to act on behalf of the issuing authority, while the
  delegate records grant the actors the power to act on behalf of the issuing authority but 
  do not by themselves provide a means for the actors to authenticate. One consensus record 
  in total plus one delegate record for each actor are used together to completely describe
  a delegation from an authority to a set of actors.
