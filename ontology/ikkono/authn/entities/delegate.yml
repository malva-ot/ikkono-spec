  agent:

    relation: N?:1

    description: >-
      The authentication method which must be used to authenticate the *agent*. May either
      refer to an authentication method declared by the individual agent, or to a 
      consensus auth method declared by the issuing principal, which in turn includes
      an auth method declared by the agent.
  statements: default

notes: >-
  A delegate allows one principal to act on behalf of another. An issuing principal (often 
  an authority) can prevent a single actor from acting unilaterally by specifying a 
  consensus auth method as the required authentication method (authnMethod).
