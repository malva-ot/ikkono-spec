notes: >-
  MultiFactorAuth gathers together a list of individual authentication methods which
  can be used to prove a principal's identity when used together. Generally the individual
  authentication methods should be declared with a restriction that they can only be
  used in a multi-factor authentication method, while the multi-factor authentication itself
  is unrestricted.
