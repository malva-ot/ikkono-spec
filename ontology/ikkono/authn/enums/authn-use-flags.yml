description: Flags restricting how an authentication method can be used
extends: scio:enum

flags:
  'none':
    name: Name
    description: No restrictions
  'ikkono:multi-factor':
    name: MultiFactor
    description: The authentication method can only be used as an element of a multi factor authentication
  'ikkono:delegate':
    name: Delegate
    description: The authentication method can only be used to authenticate on behalf of another principal, e.g. as a delegate
  'ikkono:indirect':
    name: Indirect
    description: The authentication method can only be used indirectly, e.g. by validation through a subkey or notary
  'ikkono:deferred':
    name: Deferred
    description: The authentication method cannot be used in any context

notes: >-
  Multiple AuthnUseFlags flag values should be interpreted as OR logic: The authentication method can be
  used in *any* of the flagged contexts. Because of this, the meaning of 0x0 or null is the same as an infinite flag
  with all bits set. That is, by default authentication methods are implied to be valid for use in any context.

  To define an authentication method that cannot be used at all, use `ikkono:deferred`.
