notes: >-
  To be effective, establishment warrants must include at least one identification statement so 
  that the authority being established can be authenticated, both in the initial introduction
  itself and an in any subsequent documents.

  Structurally, the establishment is usually a top-level diffstream document, while the
  identification statement(s) are embedded diffstream statements within the document.
