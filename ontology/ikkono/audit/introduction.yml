notes: >-
  To be effective, introductions must include at least one identification statement so 
  that the actor being introduced can be authenticated, both in the initial introduction
  itself and an in any subsequent documents.

  Structurally, the introduction is usually a top-level diffstream document, while the
  identification statement(s) are embedded statements within the document.
