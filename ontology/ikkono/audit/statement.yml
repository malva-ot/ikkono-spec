    description: References to the other ikkono statements which justify the validity of this statement

notes: >-
  When an ikkono statement is materialized as a root diffstream document, then both docref
  and protoref will point to the same object -- the document. If the ikkono statement is 
  materialized in a statement within a larger document, then docref will point to the document
  as a whole, while protoref will point to the individual diffstream statement within the 
  document that encoded this ikkono statement.
