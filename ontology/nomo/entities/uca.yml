notes: |
  The semantic significance of each clause of the UCA is as follows:
  - schema       : Indicates the purpose or character of the address, as well as rules for the how the address 
                   may be described, constrained, or serialized
  - authority    : The principal which declares the address. Provides permanent disambiguation
                   between otherwise similar or identical addresses
  - partition    : Each partition forms a topologically connected information space, which is topologically 
                   disconnected from any other partition. Partitions may import items from other 
                   partitions, but imports must be strictly non-cyclical to be valid.
  - partitionKey : A partition key represents an identifier for a unique instance of or variance from
                   a common underlying partition. Examples include versions of a component, environments
                   of a service, or translations of a natural language construct.
  - path         : The path is a semantic container name within a single partition. It represents an 
                   implementation-agnostic means of denoting a proper subset of the entire partition space
  - itemName     : The name of the content item itself, relative to its container (path)
  - itemKey      : An item key represents an identifier for a unique instance of or variance from
                   a common underlying item. Examples includes records within a collection
